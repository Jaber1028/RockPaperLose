# RockPaperLose
Challenge Milestone

A simple game that is like rock paper scissors, but it tells you when u want to lose or when.

Same skills used in GuessTheFlag, in addition to the same basic idea on how to play.

For a more in depth readme, look at my GuessTheFlag public repo.

This is a challenge assignment from HackingWithSwift. It was intended to be done in a day, so I have no plans to update this now.
